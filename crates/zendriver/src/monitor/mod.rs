//! Persistent network monitor: a `Stream<NetworkEvent>` over HTTP exchanges,
//! WebSocket frames, and EventSource messages. Passive (Network domain) —
//! read-only; use the `interception` feature (Fetch domain) to modify requests.
//!
//! HTTP response bodies are whole-body-buffered by default (fetched on demand
//! via [`NetworkExchange::body`]). [`MonitorBuilder::stream_bodies`] opts a
//! monitor into incremental delivery instead: [`NetworkEvent::HttpData`]
//! chunk events, emitted as the response streams in, via the passive CDP
//! `Network.streamResourceContent` mechanism — no `Fetch` interception, no
//! response pausing. See [`MonitorBuilder::stream_bodies`] for the full
//! contract, including its graceful degrade on Chrome versions that don't
//! support it.
//!
//! The correlator subscribes to the connection's loss-accounted event stream
//! ([`zendriver_transport::Connection::subscribe_raw_accounted`]), so a
//! delivery gap (a lagging subscriber, a transport reconnect or disconnect),
//! a correlation-map eviction past [`MAX_TRACKED`], or an undecodable
//! payload is surfaced as an explicit [`NetworkEvent::DeliveryBoundary`]
//! instead of silently stitching a possibly-bogus "complete" exchange,
//! silently dropping an entry, or silently skipping a malformed event. See
//! [`NetworkDeliveryBoundary`] for the full set of boundaries and
//! [`MonitorBuilder::start`] for the `Disconnected` restart contract.
