//! Per-Tab in-flight network request tracker.
//!
//! Powers [`crate::tab::Tab::wait_for_idle`] / `wait_for_idle_with` —
//! Playwright `networkidle` semantics: resolve when the set of in-flight
//! requests sustains zero for a configurable quiet window (default 500ms).
//!
//! ## Wiring
//!
//! Each [`crate::Tab`] owns one tracker. At construction time, the tab
//! spawns a background task that:
//! 1. Sends `Network.enable` once on the tab's session.
//! 2. Subscribes to three lifecycle events Chrome emits per request:
//!    - `Network.requestWillBeSent` — insert `requestId` into the set.
//!    - `Network.loadingFinished` / `Network.loadingFailed` — remove
//!      `requestId` from the set.
//!
//!    `Network.responseReceived` is deliberately **not** subscribed as a
//!    terminal event: it fires when response *headers* arrive, not when the
//!    body finishes streaming. Treating it as terminal let `wait_for_idle`
//!    report idle while a response body was still in flight — see this
//!    module's `InFlightTracker::run` for the fuller rationale.
//!
//!    A consequence worth knowing: a request that legitimately never emits
//!    `loadingFinished` — an EventSource/SSE stream, a chunked long-poll, a
//!    hung request — now stays in the in-flight set until
//!    [`IdleOptions::max_inflight_age`] evicts it, so `wait_for_idle` on such a
//!    page waits up to that age instead of resolving at header-arrival. Lower
//!    `max_inflight_age` if a streaming page must be considered idle sooner.
//! 3. Notifies the [`tokio::sync::Notify`] on every membership change so
//!    waiters can wake instantly rather than poll on a fixed interval.
//!
//! The task runs until the supplied [`CancellationToken`] fires — typically
//! when the owning Tab is dropped (P4 wires `network_cancel` into
//! `TabInner` so `Drop` triggers cancellation).
//!
//! ## Why a separate task (not poll-on-demand)
//!
//! `wait_for_idle` callers need to see the in-flight set's history, not just
//! its instantaneous value. A request that started 200ms ago and is still
//! pending when `wait_for_idle` is called must keep the count >0 until it
//! finishes. Tracking continuously lets us answer "has the count been 0 for
//! N ms?" without losing events that fired before the call.
